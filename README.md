Application is mostly done with tests, but I can't call to any of protobus message and I can't resolve this problem.

To run application just start bundle exec rails s and then you can call it to localhost:3000/to_proto with xml as body.

Unfortunetely it doesn't finish correctly, because to anyone message call doesn't work (Rails don't see class).

I tried resolve it for many hours, but I couldn't find any way to repair it.
